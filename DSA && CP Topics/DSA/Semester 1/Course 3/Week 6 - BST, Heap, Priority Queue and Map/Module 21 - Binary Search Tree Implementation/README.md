> # **```Binary Search Tree```**

A binary tree has such properties:
1. The left subtree should only have smaller values than the root node.
2. The right subtree should only have bigger values than the root node.

## **```What's about similar or duplicates of root value?```**

BST can effeciently implicates binary search algorithm due to it's binary search-able properties and it is easier to find elements in non-perfect BST O(height) time or O(log n) for a perfect BST.

## **```Why Duplicates are not allowed in a BST```**
We can take a count variable and whenever a duplicate value appears it will count it up. In most scenario duplicate values are avoided since it creates problems rotating BST.
