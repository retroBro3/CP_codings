## **```What is Algorithm?```**

An algorithm is a set of instructions or step-by-step procedures that accurately generates output in response to inputs.

**Correct and incorrect or heuristic algorithm**        
Sometime it happens that correct algorithm may take so much time, in this case even if the algorithm is correct but it cost vast computational resources. So, we must adopt an algorithm that is partially correct for that particular range of input as well as predict the result with instance of time.

Traits of a good algorithm: 
1. Correctness
2. Fast in time complexity
3. Small space 
4. General
5. Simple
6. Clever 

## **```Binary Search```**

An efficient searching algorithm that works only with sorted array. In each step this algorithm divides the input size by 2 until it finds the target element.

**Worst cases**:
1. The element resides at the last position.
2. The element doesn't exist. 

**Time Complexity**: O(log2 n)
