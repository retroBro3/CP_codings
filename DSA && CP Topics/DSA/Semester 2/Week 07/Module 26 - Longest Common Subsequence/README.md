## Subsequence or Subset
You can choose any element or character randomly in ascending order.

- You can choose element at any random position, so it is possible to ignore some character and pick from other.
- Choosed element has to be in ascending order, violation of ascending order won't make it a subsequence.
 
For example, a string "hello" is given where "eo" is a subsequence but "oe" can't be a subsequence. 

## Substring or Subarray
You have to choose element in a continuous indexed manner in ascending order. In simple form, you have to choose element in which its are serially ordered in it's actual string.

"hello" -> "ell" -> "hell"
