> # **```BFS```**

BFS is level order traversing. In order to acheive this searching manner in a graph we'll be using queue as data structure.

## Depth vs Level in Graph

## Cycles in a graph
Cycles occurs when during traversal a vertex reappears.
1. **Detecting cycles in a directed graph**: On the same path if a visited node appears, then it assure there must be a cycle in a graph.
2. **Detecting cycles in an undirected graph**: Only check if there any visited node detected again.
